# Formatting a question

Quite simply, we can take the following necessary steps while crafting our questions:

1. **Describe the issue clearly and concisely** - Be clear in the problem you're facing and what steps got you there
2. **Highlight the specific error you're experiencing** - including exact error messages can provide those helping you with valuable insight into where things went wrong
3. **Use markdown for code formatting** - this is critical, formatting your code allows your question to be more readable and approachable for those trying to understand the problem
4. **Share the relevant part of the code causing the issue** - only include what's relevant to your issue. Don't paste a whole contract into your question unless appropriate to do so. You can provide _too much_ information.

With a well formatted question, you're going to see a much higher rate of success in receiving help from others as well as AI.

> The importance of markdown formatting cannot be stressed enough. If you're unfamiliar with markdown, don't hesitate to ask an AI like ChatGPT for advice, or to format things for you.

## Wrapping Up
